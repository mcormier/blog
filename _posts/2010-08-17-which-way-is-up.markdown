In Windows 7 there is an option to change the layout of a regular file explorer window as pictured below. 

<center><img src="http://www.preenandprune.com/cocoamondo/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/mixed.png" alt="" title="mixed" width="407" height="384" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1050" /></center>

A check mark is used when a feature is active and a helpful graphic is shown if the feature is inactive.

<center><img src="http://www.preenandprune.com/cocoamondo/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/allActive.png" alt="" title="allActive" width="397" height="359" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1049" /></center>

The fact that these helpful infographics are hidden by check marks when the feature is enabled creates a one-way usability street.  It's easier to enable the features than disable them.  A user is more likely to  use trial and error when disabling these features.  Looks like there is plenty of room for those infographics on the right side of those labels though.

Kode on.
