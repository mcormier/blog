Mike Lee, formerly of <a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Monster</a>, and <a href="http://tapulous.com/">Tapulous</a>, has updated the <a href="http://unitedlemur.org/">United Lemur</a> teaser page to...  yes, you guessed it, another teaser page.

<img src="http://173.203.83.44/cocoamondo/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/lemur.png" alt="" title="United Lemur change" width="485" height="240" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-57" />

It looks likes October 9th is unofficially iPhone liberation day.  If your curiosity is still not quenched, then check out Mike's <a href="http://www.atomicwang.org/motherfucker/Index/Index.html">blog</a> where he brazenly spews forth whatever is in his brain about life, technology and how much hotter his wife is than yours.
