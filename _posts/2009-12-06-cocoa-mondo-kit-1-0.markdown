A year ago I released the <a href="http://www.preenandprune.com/cocoamondo/?p=141">MondoTextField</a>. Well I've modified the component, made some bug fixes, and wrapped it in an Interface Builder plugin called <a href="http://mcormier.github.com/CocoaMondoKit/">Cocoa Mondo Kit</a>.

It's seems slightly silly to release an Interface Builder plugin with only one component, but including the component as a framework is much cleaner than importing a bunch of source files.

Kode on!
