What's wrong with this picture?

<center><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-762" title="UIBlunder" src="http://www.preenandprune.com/cocoamondo/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/UIBlunder.png" alt="UIBlunder" /></center>
<ol>
	<li>Files Ready to be Written to the Disc</li>
	<li>The headers "Name", "Size",...,"Location"</li>
</ol>
On the first point, I've inserted a read only DVD into my machine and am shown a "Files Ready to be Written to Disc" section. How is this helpful and not confusing to regular users? Why do I care that Windows really wanted to write a file to the DVD but can't because it's read only?

The second point is more subtle. The column headers don't even apply to this icon mode. You can't resize them in this view. They are there in case you decide to switch to a view mode that might need them. Again, how is this helpful and not confusing to regular users?

The screenshot is from Vista.

Kode on!
