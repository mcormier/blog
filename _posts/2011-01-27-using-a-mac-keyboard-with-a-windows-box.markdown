So you've got an idle Mac USB keyboard laying around and you've connected it to a Windows box. But you've got a problem, <strong>CTRL-ALT-DEL </strong> doesn't work because the inaptly named delete key on a Mac keyboard is really a backspace key.   This makes it annoying to login to your locked windows machine with your small chicklet keyboard.  If your using a laptop then you can simply hit that key combination on the laptop keyboard, but you have a more difficult conundrum with a Windows desktop.

To get around this problem you can use <a href="http://www.randyrants.com/2008/12/sharpkeys_30.html">Sharp Keys</a> and map the missing delete character to a key you never use, like a function key.  Here is a configuration that maps the F1 key to the missing delete key allowing you to log into a Windows machine with a small Mac keyboard with the <strong>CTRL-ALT-F1</strong> sequence.
