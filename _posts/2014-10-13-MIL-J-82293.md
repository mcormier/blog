Several years ago I visited a friend in Japan.  We went to Kyoto for a couple of days, rented some bicycles, parked them in the wrong spot, and they got impounded.  After experiencing the strange and quirky Japanese beaurcracy first-hand (_who has an impound for bicycles?_), and paying the bicycle impound fee we stumbled upon a hip second-hand clothing store.  I purchased two vintage jackets for under a hundred dollars, one of them was a US military deck jacket manufactured in 89. The deck jacket works well in the fall and cold weather with some additional layers.

 Used military jackets have for some time been considered a hip fashion piece, providing great form, function and comfort on a budget. They're valued because their quality is quite high. The government is not interested in replacing these garments and has the scale to specify exactly what they want.

I first became aware of how much military clothing effects fashion because of William Gibson. In Pattern Recognition the lead character, who is allergic to Tommy Hilfiger and terrified of Bibendum (a.k.a the Michelin Man), takes comfort in wearing an authentic black MA-1; that never existed, but now exists due to popular consumer demand caused from the book. Two books later a major theme in Zero History is the intersection between civilian fashion and military clothing, particulary how street culture fashion is highly influenced by military clothing. The French F2 jacket has been copied by fashion designers time and time again.

Anyway, I bought an old jacket in Japan. The interesting thing about these garments is that you can get some information from the label, especially if there is a contract number. Here what's on the inside of the label:

- Contract No: **DLA100-89-C-0451**
- Name of Contractor: **Vanderbilt Shirt Co.**
- Manufacturer: **Ashland Sales &amp; services**

Removing the dashes from the contract number and searching for **DLA10089C0451** turns up some results. [This National archives][NARA_AAD] page explains what DLA stands for (Defense Logistics Agency) and that the contract was a fixed price between 1 and 2 million dollars. [This NSN-NOW][Part_number] page tells us the offical part number for the jacket is **MIL-J-82293D** or **MIL-J-82293D**. We can see clearly that the contract was awarded in 1989 which explains the 89 in the contract number, and  gives us a couple more contract numbers, issued in 94/94:

- SP010094C0350
- SP010095DCC32
- SP010094C0350

Doing some searches for **MIL-J-82293** turns up a [SAI Global][SAI_GLOBAL] page where they will give you the original 36 page spec sheet for this jacket for the small fee of $22. It also turned up a page on [EverySpec][every_spec] that explains that MIL-J-82293 was superseded by A-A-55921 in 1996, and a [downloadable PDF][every_spec_pdf] of the new A-A-55921 specification.
Unfortunately I could not find a free downloadable copy of the MIL-J-82293 specification. The internet has failed me.

The image above is from the A-A-55921 specification, the MIL-J-82293 does not have an elastic cuff around the waist, nor a throat tab. The MIL-J-82293 does have a hidden elastic knitted cuff which gives it a sharp look while functionally keep you warm in the winter. 

These jackets are commonly referred to as [deck jackets][vintage_trends] and you can buy a used one from the 80's for around $50.
