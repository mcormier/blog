Several years ago I visited a friend in Japan.  We went to Kyoto for a couple of days, rented some bicycles, parked them in the wrong spot, and they got impounded.  After experiencing the strange and quirky Japanese bureaucracy first-hand (_who has an impound for bicycles?_), and paying the bicycle impound fee, we stumbled upon a hip second-hand clothing store.  I purchased two vintage jackets for under a hundred dollars, one of them was a US military deck jacket manufactured in 89. The deck jacket works well in the fall and cold weather with some additional layers.  I decided to search the interwebs and see what I could find out about this jacket.

 Used military jackets have for some time been considered a hip fashion piece, providing great form, function and comfort on a budget. They're valued because their quality is quite high. The government is not interested in replacing these garments and has the scale to specify exactly what they want.

I first became aware of how much military clothing effects fashion because of William Gibson. In Pattern Recognition the lead character, Cayce Pollard, who is allergic to Tommy Hilfiger and terrified of Bibendum (a.k.a the Michelin Man), takes comfort in wearing an authentic black **MA-1**; that never existed, but now exists due to popular consumer demand caused from the book. Two books later a major theme in Zero History is the intersection between civilian fashion and military clothing, particulary how street culture fashion is highly influenced by military clothing. The **French F2** jacket has been copied by fashion designers time and time again.

Anyway, I bought an old jacket in Japan. The interesting thing about these garments is that you can get some information from the label, especially if there is a contract number. Here's what's on the inside of the label:

- Contract No: **DLA100-89-C-0451**
- Name of Contractor: **Vanderbilt Shirt Co.**
- Manufacturer: **Ashland Sales &amp; services**

Removing the dashes from the contract number and searching for **DLA10089C0451** turns up some results. [This National archives][NARA_AAD] page explains what DLA stands for (Defense Logistics Agency) and that the contract was a fixed price between 1 and 2 million dollars. [This NSN-NOW][Part_number] page tells us the offical part number for the jacket is **MIL-J-82293D** or **MIL-J-82293D**. We can see clearly that the contract was awarded in 1989 which explains the 89 in the contract number, and  gives us a couple more contract numbers, issued in 94/94:

- SP010094C0350
- SP010095DCC32
- SP010094C0350

Doing some searches for **MIL-J-82293** turns up a page on [EverySpec][every_spec] that explains that **MIL-J-82293** was superseded by **A-A-55921** in 1996, and a [downloadable PDF][every_spec_pdf] of the new **A-A-55921** specification.  Unfortunately I could not find a free downloadable copy of the **MIL-J-82293** specification. The internet has failed me.

The image above is from the **A-A-55921** specification, my jacket, the **MIL-J-82293** does not have an elastic cuff around the waist, nor a throat tab. The **MIL-J-82293** does have the same hidden elastic knitted cuff which gives it a sharp look while functionally keep you warm in the winter. 

Luckily with a little more searching I did find the PDF for **MIL-J-82293D**, and **MIL-J-82293C** on [assistdocs.com][assistdocs.com]. The two part numbers on [NSN-NOW][Part_number] **MIL-J-82293D** and **MIL-J-82293** are not two part numbers. The jacket is referred to as **MIL-J-82293** and the D is the revision number. From the assist docs website we know that revision D was commissioned in 88 and revision C was commissioned in 83.  Considering that there was an 8 year gap between **MIL-J-82293D** and the superceding **A-A-55921** and a 5 year gap between revisions C and D, let's assume 6 years between revisions A/B and B/C. So that means roughly:

- A-A-55921 - Issued in 1996
- MIL-J-82293D - Issued in 1988
- MIL-J-82293C - Issued in 1983
- MIL-J-82293B - Issued in 1977 (guessing)
- MIL-J-82293A - Issued in 1971 (guessing)

Looking at the specification documents of revisions D and C the garment diagram is identical. This is important because it means that the style has probably not changed much between previous revisions either.  Since we approximated that revision A was probably in 71, and this is a guess, it could be earlier or later than that.  So the overall style of the jacket is from either the late sixties or early seventies.

This is definitely the jacket. No throat tab, no elastic waist, and two chest zipper pockets. I can understand the style change in the **A-A-55921** with regards to the sleeves as it gives a more modern look to the jacket, although with the elastic waist it leans towards the college jacket spectrum.  What I can't understand is the removal of the chest pockets, on a utility jacket. One of the other beautiful things about the **MIL-J-82293** is that the lower pockets are large and blend in with the jacket well.  The **A-A-55921** pockets have been raised and the pocket slits are highlighted with material to stand out, just in case your a numbskull who has trouble finding his pockets.

Anyway, these jackets are commonly referred to as [deck jackets][vintage_trends] and you can buy a used one from the 80's for around $50. I highly recommend considering an **MIL-J-82293** and avoiding the **A-A-33921**
