One of the things I keep tabs on with <a href="http://sunflower.preenandprune.com">SunFlower</a> is apartment and housing prices.  Recently I noticed a significant drop in the price of some of the units in a yet to be built condominium called the <a href="http://www.theatrelofts.ca"> theatre lofts</a> .

<ul>
	<li>The Premiere, $194,900</li>
	<li>The Opera, $204,900</li>
</ul>

Possibly a sign of things to come.

<strong>Update (March 10th):  </strong>The prices for the premiere and opera have changed again.  They have been bumped to $279,900 and $274,900 respectively and the square footage has been increased by about 300-400 square feet.
