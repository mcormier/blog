Amar Sagoo, who wrote and released <a href="http://amarsagoo.info/namely/">Namely</a> and <a href="http://amarsagoo.info/deepnotes/">Deep Notes</a>, two of my favourite Macintosh applications, has taken the plunge into iPhone application development and written <a href="http://amarsagoo.blogspot.com/2008/12/cambio.html">Cambrio</a>.  <a href="http://amarsagoo.blogspot.com/2008/12/cambio.html">Cambrio</a> is a free unit conversion application for the iPhone platform.

Amar specializes in interaction design and all the applications he writes are very pleasurable to use.
