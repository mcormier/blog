A year ago I rearranged our apartment and created a listening room. We live in a small apartment with an open kitchen/living/dining room, and at the time, the most comfortable place in the apartment was in front of the television, in the main living area. We also have a den which was being used a computer room at the time.

There are two entrances to the den.  A regular sized door near the apartment entrance and double doors that open into the main living area. The high-fi system used to block the double doors which was a novel setup because you could open these doors from the den and have easy access to all the cabling.

The den as computer room was getting a lot less use than in previous years.  Somebody, got the bright idea to go and invent tablets, and smarty pants phones, which completely disrupted day to day desktop use and lessened the need to have a dedicated computer room. So I decided to revamp the room into a comfortable place to listen to music.

# Step 1, Measure #

First measure the size of the room, and calculate the ideal speaker position by using the rule of thirds/golden ratio. The room is an odd shape so I pretended that the it was a 12Ft x 8Ft 2.5 inch rectangle. I then measured 4Ft from the back wall and 33 inches from the side wall and put an X with slim duct tape strips on that spot.

# Step 2, De-furniturize Room #

I removed all the funiture out of the room and moved the speakers in.  Once the speakers were in place it was time for the first listening test. I put on Return to Forever featuring Chick Corea and was pleasantly surprised.

# Test 1, Rule of Thirds #

As I was planning on doing several speaker tests I digitized the room measurements.

At this point, you may be wondering how far this rabbit hole is going to go? Pretty deep.  I scoured the internet for articles about [speaker placement][speaker placement].

Here is a summary of some important points:

- It is most important to insure that the distance to the back and side walls are unequal. 
- Distance between the speakers will be determined by the distance to your listening position.
- Start with an equilateral triangle.
- The distance to the side walls affects (mainly midrange) tonal balance.
- Toe-in depends on three factors: the particular speaker you have chosen, the room and your personal preference. In general, more toe-in increases center focus, but reducing stage width.

# Step 3, Read the Manual #

I pulled out the manual for the speakers, which I never bothered to read before. They recommend a ratio where the speakers are 3/4 X apart, and X is the distance from the speaker to what your ideal sitting position will be.

# Step 4, Do the Math #

With information from step 3, the configuration for test 1 was reevaluated..
<img src="/images/listen/Test1a.jpg">
So the first thing to do is figure out what X is. Had to look up the old Pythagoras theorem (A<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup> = C<sup>2</sup>) to solve for X. 

- X = 50.76
- 3/4X = 38 inches.

So each speaker needs to move 2.5 inches closer to the wall to follow the manual recommendations for that seating configuration..

# Test 2, Pythagoras #

<img src="/images/listen/Test2.jpg">

Test 2 was a slight modification from the first test, both speakers were moved 2.5 inches closer to their respective walls and some toe-in was added.  To keep tests consistent I decided to use four songs to test all future speaker configurations. I used the the first song on each of the following albums:.

1. My Bloody Valentine/m b v - The shoe gaze test
2. Return to Forever/Hymn of the Seventh Galaxy - The funk test
3. Mark Hollis - The quiet test
4. Polvo/Siberia - The psychedelic indie rock test

The second configuration sounded nice but it has a very low WAF (wife appeal factor) and practicality factor. The following tests will increase the size of the triangle, freeing up more of the room.

# Toe-in Alignment #

The speakers were aligned with a piece of cardboard and a cat toy laser pointer.  I put the laser pointer on the center top of the speaker and rotated the speaker to the desired location.

# Test 3, X = 67 inches #

Now that I've had some practice with pythagoras theorem again I simply concentrated on the speaker distance from the wall, solved for X and placed the chair in the appropriate position.

This configuration sounded better than the previous with a more noticeable blended centre on the Return to Forever and My Bloody Valentine tracks. 

# Test 4, X = 83 inches #

You'll notice that in this diagram I added where the doors swing open.  The door nearest the double doors is for a closet so it can't be blocked off.  Because there are two entrances for the room one of them can be blocked and the room can will be usable.  With a small room, blocking off one of the doors optimizes space use.

The street window has also been added.  The window is large which is good, it helps with natural heating and makes the room feel bigger.  Unfortunately it also leaks sound from the street like a sieve. This lead me to read up on [soundproofing][home soundproofing] and found out the following interesting tidbits:

- UK environmental consultants believe that excessive levels of noise pollution can actually lead to ill health!
- The only way to stop sound is to either reduce it or absorb it.
 - **Reduction**: blocking the passage of sound waves through either the use of distance or the placing of intervening objects in the sound path 
 - **Absorption**: Making a sound wave transfer through different layers of material with different densities also assists in noise damping.
- Windows are the biggest culprit for sound entering or leaving your home.

In test 4 Return to Forever sounded fuller.  The snare popped more on the Polvo track.  In general the stereo effects were less prominent, maybe because the chair was moved back another foot and the reflections against the back wall are different considering the room does get bigger on one side.

# Test 5, X = 106 inches #

With test 3 and 4 I chose a distance from the wall for the speaker. 2ft and 1.5ft respectively. For this test I decided to create the biggest triangle possible. So I started with a distance of 7.5 ft and solved for X. This gave a distance of 9.5 inches from the front of the speaker to the wall.

Although this configuration has a high WAF factor the speakers were too close to the wall. There was a noticeable muddiness to the bass on all the songs because the sound was resonating against the walls.

# Test 6 & 7 #

Once I had the speakers too close to the wall the next step was to move them slowly away from the wall until the sound was no longer distorted by the walls. The goal being to find the biggest triangle I can get in the room with decent sound. For tests 6 and 7 the speakers were placed 12 and 15 inches from the wall respectively.

# Test 8 & 9 & 10 #

<img src="/images/listen/test8_10.jpg">

I was satisfied with the sound from test 7 but there's a lot of wasted space behind the speakers so I tried several other configurations using the same sized speaker listening point configuration. First I pushed the speakers back. Gotta get the WAF and practicality factor higher. I then experimented with rotating the triangle so the listening position was in the corner. 

I expected test 10, in the corner, to be horrible but it wasn't at all. It actually did a little better on the quiet test because the angle of the speakers and the angle of the window are different.  Later I found a very detailed [paper][corner] on why a corner position can work really well. Basically, the sound reflections that get back to your ear in the wrong position are minimized when you point the speakers at the corner.

# Furniture #

At this point I'd done 10 tests over the course of 5 days and was ready to start putting furniture back in the room.

I debated on putting two chairs in the room or a small sectional, and eventually decided on getting a small sectional to optimize for the size of the room.

I've been using this room configuration for a year now and am quite pleased with it.  My morning routine, even on working days is to make breakfast and listen to the radio in the kitchen/living area.  After breakfast, I move to this room and listen to a record.  On work days I get at least half a record in before heading out to work. On weekends I have trouble leaving the room but eventually do stir and go buy groceries or whatever.
