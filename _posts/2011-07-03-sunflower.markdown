I recently released <a href="http://sunflower.preenandprune.com/">SunFlower</a> 0.13 for free. As some people have paid for previous versions I felt it was tactful to explain the change. The process I had developed for doing releases became time consuming and a nuisance. This caused releases to be infrequent and have many changes but eventually led me to procrastinate doing any work on SunFlower at all. It has been almost two years since 0.12 was released.	I'm hoping that with some changes I'll be more likely to do releases in the future. To spur SunFlower back to life I have decided to release 0.13 even though I feel it is a rough around the edges.

The reason I have stopped charging for SunFlower is that I may start releasing more experimental versions and I may do things like change the underlying data architecture which may make upgrading a nuisance.<strong> If you want guaranteed stable software then stay on 0.13.</strong>

Although I may charge again for SunFlower in the future, it is free now. Here is a history of SunFlower that you may find interesting.

<H2>The Two-Tier Model</H2>

Before the 0.13 release version 0.12 cost $30 and version 0.8 was free. The original plan had been to release and charge for 0.13 and then release 0.9 for free. I have nicknamed this the two-tier software model. In Canada we have what is sometimes referred to as two-tier Medicare. Services are free but you can jump the queue and get a blood test without waiting in lineup by paying a fee at a clinic. Hence two tiers; <strong>slow but free and faster but fee</strong>.

The two-tier model seemed a good fit for SunFlower because it emphasised patience. It can take days, weeks or even months for a website to change. 

<H2>A Little History</H2>

SunFlower is the first Software that I have charged for. Initially the first two releases were donation ware. During this time I debated releasing the product as open source/donation ware or charging for it. While I was debating this I created many releases but did not release them. By the time 0.2 was released as donation ware I had releases 0.3-0.7 sitting on my hard drive but not publicly released. I could have just labeled version 0.7 as the third version and published it but I decided to time delay the releases instead.

I got the seed of this idea from an apocryphal story I heard from a colleague over drinks back in 2005. He claimed that Microsoft had a library of unreleased software, and if they chose to enter a market they could effectively put a release out every month until they blew their competitors out of the water. So I archived a bunch of virtual releases with the intention of releasing once a week sometime in the future. It seemed liked a potentially good marketing plan. This was back in 2007 when iOS apps didn't exist and version tracker was considered a decent place to find Mac apps.

Instead of having a rapid succession of releases as a marketing gimmick I eventually decided to try the two-tier software model described above, releasing 0.3 for free and charging for 0.8 in March of 2008. Later releasing 0.4 for free and charging for 0.9, and then releasing 0.5 for free and charging for 0.10, etc...

Building and releasing SunFlower was very exciting at first, but eventually I got bogged down with the many hats required to produce great software:

<ul>
<li>Project Manager</li>
<li>Marketing</li>
<li>Support</li>
<li>Documentation</li>
</ul>

To make things fun again I am going to concentrate on what I enjoy.  Writing software.  So enjoy the free version of SunFlower.
