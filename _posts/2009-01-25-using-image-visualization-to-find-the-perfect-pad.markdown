I've decided to move recently and I decided it was important to walk to the grocery store. I also took the location and plugged it into <a href="http://www.walkscore.com/">walkscore.com</a>. To make it easy to quickly determine how easy it was to walk to a grocery store I created the following image.

<center><a href="http://www.preenandprune.com/cocoamondo/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/grocerystores.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-324" title="grocerystores" src="http://www.preenandprune.com/cocoamondo/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/grocerystores-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150" /></a></center>The center of each circle represents a grocery store. The entire circle represents where it would be convenient to walk to that grocery store. This is fairly subjective and I thumbed it. It also doesn't take into account hills, and less pedestrian friendly roads, but it does provide a quick and easy way to determine if a location is close to a super market.
