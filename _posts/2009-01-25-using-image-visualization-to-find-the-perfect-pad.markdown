I've decided to move recently and I decided it was important to walk to the grocery store. I also took the location and plugged it into [walkscore.com][Walkscore]. To make it easy to quickly determine how easy it was to walk to a grocery store I created the following image.

<img src="/notcocoa/images/grocerystores.jpg" width="650px;"/>

The center of each circle represents a grocery store. The entire circle represents where it would be convenient to walk to that grocery store. This is fairly subjective and I thumbed it. It also doesn't take into account hills, and less pedestrian friendly roads, but it does provide a quick and easy way to determine if a location is close to a super market.
