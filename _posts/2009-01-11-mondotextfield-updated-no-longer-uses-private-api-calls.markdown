Thanks go to Paul Kim of <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/">NoodleSoft</a> for informing me about <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/blog/2007/06/30/animation-in-the-time-of-tiger-part-1/">kode</a> he wrote to zoom a window.  The <a href="http://www.preenandprune.com/cocoamondo/?p=141">MondoTextField</a> has been updated so that it no longer uses private API calls.

You can get the code by downloading this <a href="http://173.203.83.44/cocoamondo/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/mondotextfieldv2.zip">self-contained xCode project</a>, or you can access it through <a href="http://github.com/mcormier/mondotextfield/tree/master">github</a>.
