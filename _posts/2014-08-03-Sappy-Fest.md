SappyFest nine, 2014. We were non-commital on buying tickets.  The plan was to go up either Saturday or Sunday depending on the weather and not the bands, buy day passes, play croquet with randos in the afternoon, and watch some live music.  By mid-week Sunday was already sold out, so this was making us lean towards Saturday.  Saturday morning before we left they announced that Saturday was sold out.  This made Alicia a little skeptical about the whole ordeal.  "They're sold out", she said "What's the point of driving there just to play croquet?".  "It'll be fun", I encouraged, "Besides,  if we paid for day passes then we'd feel like we have to stay longer."  We had scheduled supper at her parents the day before so had to return early to get some free BBQ. We ended up getting some ceramic horse bookends and a barometer for free also, but that's a different story.

The night before I emailed Susan, to see if she was at Sappy so we could have some guaranteed people to play with.  I got a response from her in the morn that she was looking for a change and had decided to go camping instead. 

So with no guaranteed players, and a not fully sold Alicia, we piled in the car at ten in the morning.  Lady Gaga blasting most of the way.  We purchased the album "The Fame" for $5 on CD at Taz last weekend, and it's now in regular summer car rotation.  _... I wanna take a ride on your disco stick...._

On the way, I opted for the number 4 highway, forgoing the Cobequid pass, a little longer route but saving us the $4 toll.  I had a tip from my Pa that the number 4 had been mostly repaved and was an enjoyable ride in the summer.  We drove past Folly Lake and the cave near the train bridge. __Hi Hole!!__  The Lady Gaga had served it's purpose so we switched to Stephen Malkmus' self-titled from 2001, which promptly put Alicia into nap mode. _...At age nineteen I was kidnapped by Turkish pirates..._  Technically called the pre-croquet power nap.

Around noon we pulled into Sackville, got a bite to eat, and looked for a croquet location.  I thought an ideal location would be near the gazebo on main.  Unfortunately that area is currently under major reconstruction and completely fenced off.  We had to settle for the park on the corner of Bridge and Weldon, behind the main tent.

We setup a half size court, 25 feet by 50 feet, a full court would have taken over most of the park.  As we were setting up, the mounties did a drive-by, stopping for a bit in the parking lot across the way and scoping us out a bit.  This gave Alicia a little bit of pause, "Are we gonna get in trouble?".  How could we get in trouble for playing croquet in the park?  If we had had beer cans in our hands though I'm sure they would have confronted us.  It was just your standard ruffian check.  Do they look like hooligans sarge?  Nah.

After setting up the court, I ventured off to put up some signs.  While we waited for people to arrive we started a game where we each played with three balls of alternating colour order.  Winner to be determined by the first person to get all three of their balls to the last stake.  We got about half way through this game before we had our first two curious visitors.  So we restarted as a game of four.

We got about a quarter of the way through this game when one of the players recieved an emergency text message.  J<span class="redacted">redacted</span> and S<span class="redacted">redacted</span> didn't have tickets either and J<span class="redacted">redacted</span> had a lead on some tickets.  Like the civilized croquet players we pretended to be, we agreed to pause the game as he went to get tickets.  While waiting for J<span class="redacted">redacted</span>, we picked up two more stragglers, K<span class="redacted">redacted</span> and B<span class="redacted">redacted</span>.  We gave them some turns to catch up to the four of us.  When they caught up, we picked up another straggler, Kiki, who we subbed into J<span class="redacted">redacted</span> position. J<span class="redacted">redacted</span> returned later, a bit down as he didn't end up getting the tickets he was seeking.  Alicia offered her mallet so he could jump back in the game but he politely declined.  The game ended with S<span class="redacted">redacted</span> winning, followed by Alicia in second and B<span class="redacted">redacted</span> in third.

"Should we take a group photo?", I shouted.  At which point Kiki, got extremely skittish.  "I'm hungry, I got to get something to eat", she responded.  This nervousness immediately transferred to K<span class="redacted">redacted</span> and B<span class="redacted">redacted</span>.  There was a, _I really enjoyed this game of croquet, but I don't know if I'm ready to let my Facebook collective know that I actually played croquet_ vibe permeating the group.  There is high probability that Kiki was a fake festival name. Honestly, who names their child Kiki?  The group photo request was innocent.  It has been my experience that people really enjoy enacting funny poses with mallets.  Maybe we happenened upon a group of fifty percent photophobes, which seems counter-intuitive as they were brazen enough to come and ask to play with strangers.  Maybe Kiki is married to an Arabian prince in Dubai and was having her own personal strategic Margaret Trudeau, Rolling Stones weekend, but had to avoid any photographic evidence.

The group departed and we sat in the park and read the Sappy Times.  It was quarter past three and we had to leave by four to make dinner.  We really couldn't wait around until four, and didn't want to get stuck starting a game at 3:45 because then we'd be stuck until maybe 5 playing croquet.  Not a bad thing, but not ideal.  So I went and retrieved the signs we posted, and Alicia started to put the game away.  When I returned, Alicia had befriended K2<span class="redacted">redacted</span> who was interested in the game, so we put the lines back up and played a game of three.  K2<span class="redacted">redacted</span> enjoyed the game and improved very quickly.  Near the end of this game, J<span class="redacted">redacted</span> and S<span class="redacted">redacted</span> returned.  S<span class="redacted">redacted</span> gave us some buttons and his contact info, proving that it is possible to make friends when you're over thirty.
