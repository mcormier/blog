<a href="http://mattpatenaude.com/">Matt Patenaude</a> and <a href="http://lbaumann.com/">Laurent Baumann</a> who collaborate  together as <a href="http://13bold.com/">13pt BOLD</a> have released a beta twitter application called <a href="http://bluebirdapp.com/">Bluebird</a>.

Perplexingly, nowhere on the <a href="http://updates.13bold.com/release-notes/bluebird/0.921"> Bluebird</a> page does it state what Bluebird is.  I had to download it and run it to find out.  Quite forgivable though since they are in beta.

Discovered with <a href="http://sunflower.preenandprune.com">SunFlower</a>.
