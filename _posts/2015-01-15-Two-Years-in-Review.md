I planned to do a year in review post last year but it fell on the floor.  I took three weeks off for Christmas vacation in 2013 and had so much time on my hands that a year in review post about Tallyman turned into a historical software design planning document that no one will ever want to read.

So let's try this again. I started Tallyman in late 2012 and have been collecting statistics about myself for myself. We all know that companies have databases where they collect information on us, so they can sell us more stuff.  That just doesn't seem fair.  So now I have a database about me for me, and everything works in reverse, sort of.

# Fitness #

Before starting this Tallyman project I was really bad at logging my gym benchmark data so I'll just list three improvements from 2013 to 2014. You can see most of the historical data on [stats.preenandprune.com][stats] FYI, I'm not overly eager to increase these numbers and am actually quite cautious when it comes to lifts.  If I haven't been to the gym for a while, which happens more often than not, I'll look at the historical data for my lifts and take several weeks to get back up to a past maximum.

# Reading #

These numbers are really just something to motivate me to read more. The pages read statistic is virtually useless as it doesn't count for things like font size and reading level.  Pynchon is always a harder read then Wolfe.  These stats aren't even that accurate by year because if I start a book in December and finish it January it gets logged for the January year.  All these faults could be fixed by changing what is logged and logging more frequently, but that just adds more work without significant gain.

P.S. The gap of 8 books to 5 is statistically accurate, however I decided to log "There's a Wocket in My Pocket" in 2013 so this number is also misleading. It's very easy to skew this stat by reading lots of childrens books.

# Music #

I've started consuming significantly more music since this project began.  The main reason for this being that I've rearranged rooms and have converted a room that used to be a "Computer Room" to a "Listening/Morning Room".  This deserves a posting unto itself, which I've been meaning to write for some time, so I won't go into detail on this with the intention of writing about that in the future. Simply want to note that the act of monitoring this is not a main influencer in the increase.

# Future #

I have a vision for where Tallyman is going.  The initial version of the software was written quickly to get an end to end implementation, so now there is a lot of work to reverse the technical debt incurred.  I'm slowly refactoring PPCurses so that the project can move forward.  In the past I've let things stew in my brain until a sprint of extra-curricular coding occurs, but lately I've been attempting to code a little each day.  I've been using the github contributions graph as motivation.  This means quite often I check in unfinished code but it helps to keep the project code in my current memory.

I'll just keep plugging away at this project and see where it goes. ;)
