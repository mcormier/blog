title:  "My First Ikea Hack"

---

I recently moved my stack of Expedits.  Instead of having them against the wall, on top of each other uniformly, I chose to stack them at the end of a hallway, 1/4 off centre.  This naturally extends the hallway, helps divide the room into sections, and provides access to the Expedits from both sides.   The asymmetrical stacking created two small shelves that can be used to display things like greeting cards, or flowers.

Of course, moving the shelves caused another issue. There is no light for browsing records in the new location.  _What ever could be done?_ Like any self respecting middle class Mr. Fix-It I headed down to the local cavernous box of a house fixing store and stared at LED lights for a while. "**Hey! Look this one has a remote control and you can change the light color.**" Eventually I settled on a Sylvania light flute.  It has a plastic base, the light is detachable and can be used as an emergency flashlight if the power goes out. I can detach it and wave it at the cat to create a cheap strobe light effect, which she seems quite bemused  with. However, she's also quite fascinated with boxes and grocery bags.  Meh; the life of a house cat.

I considered painting the base black to match the bookcase but opted instead to paint it silver to match the flute.  Enamel paint is a few dollars and applied it with a sponge.  Once it dried I scraped it a little with a piece of sand paper. This didn't perfectly match the brushed metal of the flute but looks better than flat paint.

The base of the flute light is magnetic.  So instead of buying multiple lights and permanently affixing them to the bookcase, I decided to find several metal plates to affix to the bookcase. This would allow one light to be attached and detached in different configurations willy nilly.  Someone told me I should patent this idea.  _What would I be patenting?_  [Magnets? How do they work?][magnets]

I put the light in my murse and went galavanting in search of metal to meet my needs.  The base of the light flute is two and three quarter inches in diameter.  The first potential candidate was a mason jar lid, which was the same size.  Unfortunately, mason jar lids only have a slight metal coating on the top, the bottom is waxy, so it was not strong enough to hold the base to the wall.  I found some candle holders which worked well at holding the base, but due to their convex shape they did not work with the flute portion of the flute light.

Eventually I found some candles with metal lids the right size.  They also have a decorative lip, to the detriment of the dough scraper a close runner-up, which help hold the base of the light in place. 

Choosing the candle lids had the added bonus of giving my honey two smelly candles.  She likes smelly things.  Hopefully this good deed, and future ones like it, will allow me to keep building my record collection when I'm an octogenarian. I had a conversation with an older gentlemen, while waiting in line at a record fair, where he mentioned that his wife had given him an ultimatum many years ago.  "One for one", he said.  "For every record I bring into the house now, I must get rid of one". My, oh, my, let's pray that I find some way to walk the tight rope of music obsession and a blissful home life as the years go by.

Since the metal candle lid is a lid, the gap between the bottom of the lid and the bookcase needed to be filled.  Wood and silicone. Wood and silicone.

And a clamp.  Wood, silicone and a clamp.

Here is the final result.
