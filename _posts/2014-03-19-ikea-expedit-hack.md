title:  "My First Ikea Hack"

---

I recently moved my stack of Expedits.  Instead of having them against the wall, on top of each other uniformly, I chose to stack them at the end of a hallway, 1/4 off centre.  This naturally extends the hallway and helps divide the room into sections.   The asymmetrical stacking created two small shelves that can be used to display things like greeting cards, or flowers.

Of course, moving the shelves caused another issue. There is no light for browsing records in the new location.  _What ever could be done?_ Like any self respecting middle class Mr. Fix-It I headed down to the local cavernous box of a house fixing store and stared at LED lights for a while. **Hey! Look this one has a remote control and you can change the light color.** Eventually I settled on a Sylvania light flute.  It has a plastic base but the light is detachable. It can be used as an emergency flashlight if the power goes out. I also can detach it and wave it at the cat to create a cheap strobe light effect, which she seems quite fascinated with. However, she's also quite fascinated with boxes and grocery bags.  Meh, the life of a house cat.

I considered painting the white base black to match the book case but opted instead to paint it silver to match the flute.  I purchased silver enamel paint for a few dollars and applied it with a sponge.  Once it dried I scraped it a little with piece of sand paper.

The base of the flute light is magnetic.  So instead of buying multiple lights I decided to find several metal plates to affix to the book case and attach and detach the light to said metal implement as needed.  Someone told me I should patent this idea.  What would I be patenting?  Magnets? How do they work?

I put the light in my murse and went galavanting in search of a piece of metal the right size.  The base of the light flute is two and three quarter inches in diameter.  The first potential candidate I found was a mason jar lid, which was close to the same size.  Unfortunately, mason jar lids only have a slight metal coating on one side so it was not strong enough to hold the base to the wall.  I found some candle holders which worked well at holding the base but due to their convex shape did not work with the flute portion of the flute light.

Eventually I found some candles that had metal lids which were the right size.  They also have a decorative lip, to the detriment of the dough scraper that was a close runner-up, which help to hold the base of the light in place when it is affixed to a wall. 

Choosing the candle lids had the added bonus of giving my honey two smelly candles.  She likes smelly things.  Hopefully this good deed, and future ones like it, will allow me to keep building my record collection when I'm an octogenarian. I had a conversation with an older gentlemen, while waiting in line to get into a record fair, that his wife had given him an ultimatummany years ago.  "One for one", he said.  "For every record I bring into the house now, I must get rid of one". My, oh, my.

Since the metal candle lid is a lid, the gap between the top of the lid and the bookcase needed to be filled.  Wood and silicone my son, wood and silicone.

And a clamp.  Wood, silicone and a clamp.

Here is the final result.
