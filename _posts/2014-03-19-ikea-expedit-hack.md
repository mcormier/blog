title:  "My First Ikea Hack"

---

I recently moved my stack of Expedits.  Instead of having them against the wall I chose to stack them at the end of a hallway.  This naturally extended the hallway and help divide the adjoining room.  Instead of stacking them uniformly on top of each other I decided to stack them 1/4 off center.  This created two extra small shelves two allow my better half a place for nick nacks.

Of course, moving the shelves caused another issue as there is no light for browsing records in the new location.  _What ever could be done?_ Like any self respecting middle class Mr. Fix-It I headed down to the local cavernous box of a house fixing store and stared at LED lights for a while. Eventually I settled on a Sylvania light flute.  It has a plastic base but the light is detachable. This means it can be used as an emergency flashlight if the power goes out. I also can detach it and wave it at the cat to create acheap strobe light effect, which she seems quite fascinated with.

I considered painting the white base black to match the book case but opted instead to paint it silver to match the flute.  I purchased silver enamel paint for a few dollars and applied it with a sponge.  Once it dried I scraped it a little with piece of sand paper.

The base of the flute light is magnetic.  So instead of buying multiple lights I decided to find several metal plates to affix to the book case and attach and detach the light to said metal implement as needed. 

I put the light in my murse and went galavanting in search of a piece of metal the right size.  The base of the light flute has a two and three quarter inch diameter.  The first potential candidate I found was mason jar lid, which was close to the same size.  Unfortunately, mason jar lids only have a slight metal coating on one side so it was not strong enought to hold the base to wall.  I found some candle holders which worked well at holding the base but due to the convex shape did not allow use the flute portion of the flute light.

Eventually I found some candles that that had metal lids which were the right size.  They also have a decorative lip, to the detriment of the dough scraper that was a close runner-up, which help to hold the base of the light in place when it is affixed to a wall. 

Choosing the candle lids had the added bonus of giving my honey two smelling candles.  She likes smelly things.  Hopefully this good deed, and future ones like it, will allow me to keep building my record collection when I'm an octogenarian.

Since the metal candle lid is a lid the gap between the top of the lid and the bookcase needed to be filled.  Wood and silicone my son, wood and silicone.

And a clamp.  Wood, silicone and a clamp.

Here is the final result.
