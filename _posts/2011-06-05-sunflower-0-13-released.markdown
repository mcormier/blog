I am happy to announce the release of <a href="http://sunflower.preenandprune.com">SunFlower 0.13</a>. As there are some user interface changes I have decided to post a brief walkthrough of the changes.

<H3>The Persistence Pane</h3>
A new persistence pane has been added to subscription inspector.  It adds several new features when managing your subscriptions.

<h3>Subscriptions Warnings</h3>
A subscription can may now have a warning associated with it.  To get more information on the warning click the exclamation point.

The subscription may be suspended because there are many unviewed snapshots and if this is the case, the following message will be displayed.

This warning may also appear if you are trying to capture a very large page on a 32-bit Mac.  In that case the following message will be displayed.

<H3>Capture View Toobar</H3>
Finally there is now a toolbar at the bottom of the capture view and several buttons have been moved from the application toolbar to this toolbar.
